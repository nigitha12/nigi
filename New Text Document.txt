Vadivelu is known to assist directors, with his own input being used during sets. The hallmark of his comedy was self-deprecation. Vadivelu's characters thought very highly of themselves â€“ they were clownish versions of the gang leader. After a certain stage of success, he started to act as a solo comedian, supported by other minor comedians.

Cashing in on his popularity, he starred in the lead role of the historical comedy in the film Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei. The movie was declared a blockbuster and was widely acclaimed for its 'clean' comedy. Vadivelu played in a dual role, playing twin brothers of a heartless but comical dictator king and a revolutionary. His next venture as the lead star was in the movie Indiralogathil Na Azhagappan (2008).
